== README

This is the Readme for my Accelerate project,

Whats the number one reason why one is not able to approach another that they find interesting?

Answer: Because they're shy!

I officialy started coding this application on Sunday October 5th

Explanation of app:

So this app will start off with the User making a profile.

The profile will have one picture(selfie) and an attributes page
(Reuqired*)

-Hair*
-Eye Color*
-Height*

With that there will also be an optional daily attribute page
-Jewlery (Watch, Earrings, ring)
-Glasses(y/n)
-Shirt Color
-Shoe Type / Shoe Color


With your profile kept hidden and anonymous, there will be a news feed that the user will post on anonymously

Other users will be able to see this post within a 1 mile radius

When the user posts he/she will have to do the following

Fill out a brief message (Max 50 Characters) 
about the person he/she would like to talk to

Mark which attributes the signifigant other contains including 
-Hair*
-Eye Color*
-Height*
and as well as the optional attributes
-Jewlery (Watch, Earrings, ring)
-Glasses(y/n)
-Shirt Color
-Shoe Type / Shoe Color

Example Annonymous post

(What the public will be able to see)
Post: "Hey Blonde with the Tan leather Jacket your boots are swag!"
(The attributes will be hidden in the post)
-Blonde
-Green Eyes
-Medium (5'4 - 5'8)
Optional
-Watch[Gold]
-Glasses[Clear]
-Boots[Green]

So users within the one mile radius will be able to refresh the feed real time and see only 

"Hey Blonde with the leather Jacket your boots are swag!"

Here's where it gets cool

In the above example if the person(being annonymously posted about) are matched they will recieve a notification saying "Hello! Someone might have posted about you! Try and talk to them"

The blonde checks the post to see if shes in the mood to talk to that stranger who posted about them, and with the correct number of attributes matched up they will be able to see the picture of the person who posted about them but only within that one mile radius.

So with this said the blonde will have the option to reply with another annoymous post about that user and will mark the attributes

Example reply

"Hey guy in the Navy blue Vest with the grey shirt you're killing it today!"

Attributes(hidden)
-Black hair
-Brown eyes
-Tall
-Watch[Silver]
-No Glasses

The guy will be notified because the blonde he tryed posting about has reached back to him with matched attributes because they would now like to converse in person

From there the guy will have the chance to reply with an invitiation to sit down and chat, or not reply and hope that a different person was talking about him. (You have nothing to lose but there is very little chance of rejection if the attributes are so specific)

The driving forces for this to work is participation and more replys
